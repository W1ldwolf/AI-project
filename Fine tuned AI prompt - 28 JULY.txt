I need you to create the below components as per instructions.

1. Environment Configuration details

Instructions: 

Use the file D:\Apps\AI project\Deployment\db_config.env containing below parameters for the deployment. The script should only read the parameters for the deployment and it should not store any data.
ORACLE_USER=your_username
ORACLE_PASSWORD=your_password
ORACLE_TNS=your_tns_alias
ORACLE_SCHEMA=your_schema 

2. Script Categorization & Execution Order

Instructions: 

Ensure that the below objects are created in the correct order to resolve dependencies.
01_tables/
02_indexes/
03_sequences/
04_views/
05_types/
06_packages/
07_package_bodies/
08_triggers/
09_synonyms/

Optional:
pre_deployment/: Backup or validation scripts
post_deployment/: Grants, logging, cleanups.


3. Transaction Management

Instructions:

Wrap related DDL/DML in transactions when possible.
Use WHENEVER SQLERROR EXIT in SQL*Plus or SQLcl to stop on failure.
Log execution output and errors clearly.
Use save points in large scripts.

4.Idempotency Handling

Instructions:

Your scripts should be re-runnable safely.
Check existence before CREATE or DROP (e.g., SELECT * FROM user_tables WHERE table_name = 'MY_TABLE').
Use CREATE OR REPLACE for views, procedures, packages.
Drop and recreate when needed (carefully).

5.Deployment Tooling & Execution

Instructions:

The script should run based on SQL*Plus and deploy all the components from  warehouse_order_management.sql, warehouse_order_management_with_orderid_limit.sql to Oracle database one by one.

6.Backup and Rollback

Instructions:

Backup current schema (expdp, logical export, or Git snapshot)
Include Optional rollback scripts (DROP newly created objects or restore from backup)

7. User Permissions & Grants

Instructions:

Ensure the deployment user has CREATE, ALTER, DROP, EXECUTE privileges
GRANT permissions where required
Create grants script to apply to application/service users

8.Logging and Auditing


Instructions:

Log What script was run, When, By whom, On which DB.
Save logs per object or per module.

Optional: Insert logs into an audit table

9. Folder structure for deployment:

Instructions:

Directory Structure should be created or overlapped in the location D:\Apps\AI project\Deployment as below

/oracle-deployment-currentdate/

│   ├── 01_tables/
